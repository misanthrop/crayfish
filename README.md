# Welcome

**Luada: Lua Desktop Automation** is lightweight library to write desktop automation scripts in Lua.
Now it supports only [X window system](http://www.x.org/wiki/), but Windows support is planned soon.

# Usage

Luada is shared library. So simply load it from your Lua script using **require**.
